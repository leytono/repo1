class second{
	//this is teh second class, only the one which has the name of the file should be public. 
}

/*public class third {
	this will get compilation error, only one should be public and have the same name as the file
	if "public class pg4comment" becomes "class pg4comment" the we can create more classes and no compilation error
	So if all the class in a java file are non-public the file name can be anything. Good to know.
